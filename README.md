EE 250 - Project: Kenta Lin and Diego Mendez



This project serves as a trading node. An authorized user is allowed to buy and trade stocks on a device. 

The project uses two sensors: a camera with facial recognition and a rotary angle sensor that is the user's input. The camera functions as a security measure - in order to buy, sell, and obtain information about the trading profile, the camera must determine that the user is the correct person. The rotary encoder will be used to get a user input for how many shares can be bought. 

In order to obtain any information about the stock market or the user's trading profile, the program uses Alpaca API. This api is very versatile and free to use for individuals. To properly disclose for the sake of the project, this is using the paper trading feature availible in the API, so there is NO REAL FUNDS being used.

Necessary Command Line Prompts:

    pip install alpaca-trade-api    <--  If this doesn't work, its ok, its most important to get the next

    pip install alpaca-py

    pip intsall transitions
